# Turtle-Games (Pending)
Analysis of sales and customer engagement data for Turtle Games, focusing on loyalty points, customer segmentation, and sentiment analysis of reviews to inform business strategies and improve sales performance.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales and customer review data for **Turtle Games**, a global game manufacturer and retailer. The company sells a variety of products, including books, board games, video games, and toys. The goal of this analysis is to improve overall sales performance by identifying trends in customer behavior, particularly regarding **loyalty points**, **customer segmentation**, and **text data from reviews**.

The analysis aims to provide insights into customer engagement, segmentation for targeted marketing, and the use of customer feedback to inform business decisions.

### Key Business Questions:
1. How do customers engage with and accumulate loyalty points?
2. How can customers be segmented into groups, and which groups can be targeted by the marketing department?
3. How can text data (e.g., customer reviews) be used to inform marketing campaigns and make improvements to the business?
4. Can descriptive statistics (e.g., normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis) help assess the suitability of the loyalty points data for creating predictive models?

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data exploration, analysis, and visualization using the following libraries:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning (if applicable).
- **R**: For additional statistical analysis, visualizations, and hypothesis testing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting analysis in an interactive environment.

## Files Included
- **`turtle_reviews.csv`**: Details on customer gender, age, remuneration, spending score, loyalty points, education, language, platform, review and summary across products.
- **`metadata_turtle_games.txt`**: Details of the data set, data quality, and reference.

## Key Questions Explored
- **Customer Engagement with Loyalty Points**: How do customers interact with and accumulate loyalty points across different product categories?
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying distinct customer groups using clustering techniques to help the marketing team target specific segments.
- **Text Data Utilization**: How can customer reviews be analyzed to derive actionable insights for improving product offerings and marketing campaigns?
- **Descriptive Statistics for Predictive Models**: Exploring the distribution of loyalty points data to evaluate its suitability for predictive models. This includes looking at skewness, kurtosis, and potential normalization of data.

## Insights and Analysis
### Data Exploration:
- **Loyalty Points Accumulation**: Analysis of trends in how customers are accumulating loyalty points and identifying the factors that influence higher accumulation rates.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to identify different customer groups and their characteristics, which can help the marketing team in targeting specific segments more effectively.
- **Review Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing customer reviews to uncover common themes, sentiment trends, and feedback that can be used for business improvements.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Assessing the normality of the loyalty points data and determining its suitability for predictive modeling (e.g., linear regression, classification).

### Visualizations:
- **Loyalty Points Trends**: Line graphs showing how loyalty points accumulate over time.
- **Customer Segments**: Visualizations of customer clusters, showcasing key differences between segments.
- **Sentiment Trends**: Word clouds and sentiment analysis charts based on customer reviews.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Charts showing skewness, kurtosis, and distribution of loyalty points data.
